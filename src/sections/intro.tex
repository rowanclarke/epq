\label{intro}

Machine learning and artificial intelligence is a topic that is rising in popularity. It is commonly regarded as a complex process that is difficult to understand, and thus has inspired me to understand the process of machine learning. This dissertation should arrive at a simple conclusion that justifies the extent of the usage of machine learning, through an intuitive understanding of machine learning. 

However, we cannot simply jump to the topic of machine learning, as we would therefore be assuming that it can be classified as learning itself. If we were to say that machines can learn, we would need to understand what learning is, and how it can be used to produce a computational \gls{model}. 

To find the extent to which any problem can be solved using machine learning, we would have to understand how to determine a suitable model given our problem and find limitations in the \gls{model}. Then we can find optimisations to overcome these limitations.

Using this information, we walk through an optimisation to our own problem, justifying the ability to create and model all problems. This then follows nicely into the current and future uses of machine learning, where we discuss how machine learning has already been implemented into certain markets and how this will evolve given the current research into the area.
